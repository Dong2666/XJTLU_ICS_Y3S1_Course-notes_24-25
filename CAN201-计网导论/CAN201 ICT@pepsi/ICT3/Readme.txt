Dear all,

The score of the ICT 3 has been released, and here is some general feedback:

   1. For Q1, initial flow entry running on switch should be displayed, rather than the code running on the controller.

   2. For Q2, the interaction between switch and controller should be explicitly mentioned.

   3. For Q3, the specific and accurate code lines (regarding certain protocol) should be displayed.

   4. For Q4,  the interaction between switch and controller should be explicitly mentioned.

   5, For Q5, the code must be run-able. It must be the revision based on the given lab11.py
